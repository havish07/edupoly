    What is an earthquake? </h1>

A normal (dip-slip) fault is an inclined fracture where the rock mass above an inclined fault moves down (Public domain.)
An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
