            <h1> India out to shed the substantial weight of being the nearly-men</h1>
            Rohit Sharma had already begun responding to the first question at the press conference when fireworks continued to go off at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, marking a fiery end to a sodden Asia Cup. In his inimitable droll, the winning Indian captain stopped his answer to quip, 'Arre, World Cup jeetne ke baad phodo yaar ye sab' (Save the fireworks for when we win the World Cup).

The appetite for major silverware whetted, Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid turn to the World Cup, each coveting the one missing item from their otherwise impressive CVs. In their two-year run, both have endeavoured to get the team playing a more dynamic brand of white-ball cricket. They will know, however, that nothing other than being anointed World Champions would constitute a successful campaign. For India have been the nearly-men at ICC events for a decade now, a truly ludicrous stretch for a team of their talent and resources.

            Although they aren't among the favourites heading into the World Cup, a come-from-behind series win against Australia will give South Africa and its fans a lot of confidence
